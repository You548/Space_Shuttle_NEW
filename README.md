All the space shuttles except challenger went through a livery update in 1998. This changed the flag placment and added the NASA meatball on its left wing. I implimented this into the mod with a 1980 varient and a modern varient on all the shuttles. Only exception is challenger which only lasted 9 missions before flying its fatal 10th for STS-51L on January 28th, 1986.

Installation: 
1. Remove any previous versions of Space Shuttle System from GameData
2. Put the folder named "SPACE_SHUTTLE_SYSTEM" into your KSP GameData
3. Put the folder Riquired Mods into Your KSP GameData

### Shadows

Scatterer, even on the very high preset, has shadow errors on the shuttle cargo bay.

To fix this, go to the space center and click on scatterer ->  Customize Settings -> Shadows -> Long-Distance terrain shadows and input the following:

- Shadow cascade splits: 0.002,0.005,0.015
